Here we are going to use BART to do the Text Summarization.
Steps involved for implementing a SUmmarization technique are:- 
1. To use large language models (LLMs) for text summarization, you can fine-tune a pre-trained model on a summarization dataset. Here's a general overview of the steps involved:

2. Dataset: Obtain a suitable dataset for text summarization. This dataset should consist of pairs of source texts (longer documents) and their corresponding summaries (shorter texts). Commonly used datasets for text summarization include CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, or custom domain-specific datasets.

3. Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by tokenizing the texts, removing unnecessary elements (e.g., HTML tags, special characters), and converting the texts into a format suitable for model training. You can use libraries like NLTK or spaCy for tokenization and preprocessing tasks.

4. Model Selection: Choose a pre-trained LLM suitable for text summarization tasks. Transformers models like BART, T5, or Pegasus are often used for this purpose due to their encoder-decoder architectures.

5. Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the selected LLM using the preprocessed dataset. This step involves training the model on the source texts and teaching it to generate accurate summaries. The fine-tuning process typically requires a powerful GPU and can take a significant amount of time.

6. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your fine-tuned model using appropriate metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). ROUGE measures the overlap between the generated summary and the reference summary.

7. Deployment: Once your model is trained and evaluated, you can deploy it for text summarization. This can be done through an API or by integrating the model into an application or website.

8. It's important to note that fine-tuning LLMs requires significant computational resources, and you may need a large amount of annotated data for optimal performance. Additionally, keep in mind the ethical considerations and potential biases associated with text summarization.

9. Several libraries and frameworks, such as Hugging Face's Transformers, provide pre-trained models and tools to simplify the process of training and using LLMs for text summarization. You can refer to their documentation and example code for more detailed guidance on fine-tuning models for specific tasks.
