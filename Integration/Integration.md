There are a few ways to integrate Python scripts with JavaScript. One way is to use the pyscript library. This library allows you to run Python code from within a web page. To use the library, you first need to install it. You can do this with the following command:


npm install pyscript

'''html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pyscript/0.1.15/pyscript.min.js"></script>

<script>

pyscript.init({

  // The path to the Python script

  path: "/path/to/script.py",

  // The name of the global variable that will be used to access the Python object

  globals: "my_object",

});

</script>
'''
