There are a few ways to integrate Python scripts with JavaScript. One way is to use the pyscript library. This library allows you to run Python code from within a web page. To use the library, you first need to install it. You can do this with the following command:


npm install pyscript

'''html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pyscript/0.1.15/pyscript.min.js"></script>

<script>

pyscript.init({

  // The path to the Python script

  path: "/path/to/script.py",

  // The name of the global variable that will be used to access the Python object

  globals: "my_object",

});

</script>
'''

This code will load the Python script and create a global variable called my_object. You can then use this variable to access the Python object from within the JavaScript code.

Another way to integrate Python scripts with JavaScript is to use the node-pyscript library. This library allows you to run Python code from within a Node.js environment. To use the library, you first need to install it. You can do this with the following command:

npm install node-pyscript

Once the library is installed, you can start using it. To run a Python script from within a Node.js environment, you can use the following code:

const pyscript = require("node-pyscript");

// Run the Python script

pyscript.run("path/to/script.py");
